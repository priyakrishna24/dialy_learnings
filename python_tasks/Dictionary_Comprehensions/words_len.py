'''
You are going to use Dictionary Comprehension to create a dictionary called result that takes each word in the given sentence and calculates the number of letters in each word.   
Try Googling to find out how to convert a sentence into a list of words.  *

*Do NOT** Create a dictionary directly.
Try to use Dictionary Comprehension instead of a Loop. 
To keep this exercise simple, count any punctuation following a word with no whitespace as part of the word. Note that "Swallow?" therefore has a length of 8

sentence = "What is the Airspeed Velocity of an Unladen Swallow?"
res = sentence.split()
result={word:len(word) for word in sentence.split() }
print(result)
print(res)
